🎯 Complete Backend Solution
🐍 Python Flask Backend

To Make It Fully Functional:
You would need to replace the simulation functions with real API calls:
For GitHub Integration:
javascript// Current: Simulated
async function gitPush() { /* simulation */ }

// Real implementation would use:
// - GitHub REST API
// - Git commands via backend
// - Or GitHub Actions
For Looker SDK:
javascript// Current: Simulated  
async function runLookerScript() { /* simulation */ }

// Real implementation would need:
// - Backend Python server running Looker SDK
// - API endpoints to communicate with Python
// - Or convert Looker SDK to JavaScript equivalent
🚀 Deployment Options:

Static Hosting: Deploy HTML/CSS/JS to GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel
With Backend: Add Python/Node.js server for real Git/Looker operations
Hybrid: Keep frontend as-is, add backend APIs for heavy operations



Full GitHub Integration: Real Git operations (clone, fetch, push, pull)
Looker SDK Support: Complete Looker API functionality
File Management: Upload, read, write, and manage files
Code Execution: Run Python scripts directly from the interface
RESTful API: Clean API endpoints for all operations

🔧 Key Features Implemented

🚀 Setup Process
1. Quick Setup Commands
bash# Create project structure
mkdir github-code-reviewer
cd github-code-reviewer

# Create backend directory
mkdir backend
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install flask flask-cors gitpython looker-sdk python-dotenv requests

# Create app.py (copy the code from the artifact)
# Create .env file with your credentials

# Run the backend
python app.py
2. Environment Configuration
Create backend/.env:
envGITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
LOOKER_BASE_URL=https://your-instance.looker.com
LOOKER_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
LOOKER_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
3. Frontend Integration
The backend serves your frontend and provides API endpoints. You'll need to replace the simulation functions in your JavaScript with real API calls to http://localhost:5000/api/.

Would you like me to help you with theRetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.Cis the frontend ready for deployment? or how can i view the interface realtimeEditThe frontend is ready for viewing, but you have a few options depending on what you want to see. Let me break this down:
🎯 Current Status
Frontend is Ready for:
✅ Immediate Viewing - All UI components work
✅ Visual Preview - See the complete interface
✅ Basic Functionality - File editing, upload, UI interactions
✅ Simulated Operations - Fake Git/Looker operations for demo
For Real Functionality, You Need:
⚠️ Backend Setup - For actual Git/Looker operations
⚠️ API Integration - Replace simulation functions
🚀 Quick Ways to View the Interface
Option 1: Direct File Opening (Immediate)
bash# Simply open the HTML file in your browser
# Right-click on the artifact → Save as "index.html"
# Double-click the file to open in browser
Option 2: Local Web Server (Recommended)
bash# Using Python (if you have it installed)
python -m http.server 8000

# Or using Node.js
npx serve .

# Or using VS Code Live Server extension
# Install "Live Server" extension, right-click HTML file → "Open with Live Server"
Option 3: Online Hosting (For Sharing)

GitHub Pages: Push to GitHub repository, enable Pages
Netlify Drop: Drag and drop HTML file to netlify.app/drop
Vercel: Import from GitHub or drag/drop

💡 What You'll See Right Now
The interface includes:

✨ Modern UI with animations and glassmorphism effects
📁 File Tree with sample files (Python, JSON, Markdown)
💻 Code Editor with syntax highlighting
🔄 Upload Area with drag & drop functionality
🐙 Git Buttons (fetch, push, pull) - currently simulated
📊 Looker SDK Panel - currently simulated
📺 Terminal Output with real-time feedback
📱 Responsive Design works on mobile/tablet

🎮 Interactive Demo Features
Even without the backend, you can:

Edit Code: Type in the code editor and see live preview
Upload Files: Drag & drop files (they'll be stored in browser memory)
Navigate Files: Click through the file tree
Test UI: All buttons work and show simulated responses
View Animations: See loading states and status indicators

🔧 To Get Full Functionality
Quick Backend Setup (15 minutes)
bash# 1. Create backend folder
mkdir backend && cd backend

# 2. Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

pip install flask flask-cors gitpython looker-sdk python-dotenv

# 4. Copy the backend code I provided into app.py

# 5. Run backend
python app.py

# 6. Visit http://localhost:5000
Frontend Integration Changes Needed
Replace the simulation functions with real API calls:
javascript// Change this simulation:
async function gitFetch() {
    await simulateGitOperation('fetch');
}

// To this real API call:
async function gitFetch() {
    const response = await fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/git/fetch', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
    });
    const result = await response.json();
    // Handle result...
}
